# Airtable

[Airtable](https://airtable.com/) is a spreadsheet-database hybrid, with
the features of a database but applied to a spreadsheet. The fields in an Airtable table
are similar to cells in a spreadsheet, but have types such as 'checkbox', 'phone number',
and 'drop-down list', and can reference file attachments like images.
